> I try to keep up to date with big ML and DL papers and meanwhile learn more about how the word where we live in works

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my repository but mainly I have a lot of school work
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Assembly, better c++, and always learning about ML
- 💬 Ask me about any tech related stuff or about physic (if you ask me something that I can't answer that's great. It means I will learn 📚).
