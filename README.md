<summary><strong>Learn More about me 🧐 </strong></summary>
> I try to keep up to date with big ML and DL papers and meanwhile learn more everyday.

- 🤖 I'm currently doing a master in [Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.units.it) at the [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/en)
- 🔭 I spend most of my time at university studying and learning new things.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning a bit of Assembly, better C++ and Python, and always learning about ML
- 💬 Ask me about any tech related stuff or about physics (if you ask me something that I can't answer that's great. It means I will learn 📚).
